Explore the use of a hybrid convolutional autoencoder and LSTM on e-commerce data from ``Prisguiden.no''.
The datasets from ``Prisguiden.no'' have not previously been explored through the use of time series predictions,
and all experimentation done on the dataset is new research.
In addition to testing the hybrid model on the dataset,
we also expanded on the experimentation with the hybrid model.
The model is based on the work done in \cite{Zhao2019} where the model type is proposed on a time series problem.
However, the model tested here is only a local univariate model, and no experimentation data was found
on the use of either global or multivariate model variations.
Therefore, we increase the experimental domain on which the proposed hybrid model is applied and tested,
in an effort to evaluate the model's predictive ability with new use-cases.
