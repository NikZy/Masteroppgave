\subsection{Error metric}
\todo[inline]{TODO: Remove this sections. It is copied to experimental plan}
Since we are working with multiple time series and each time series might differ in scale.
When choosing an error metric, we have to accommodate a number of factors.
Since our time series are of different scales, we cannot use a scale-dependent metric
like MSE or MAE.

Our data consists of positive integers. The possibility of zero-values does exist,
so SMAPE with the division-by-zero-fix as described in \Cref{section:BT:Loss} is a good candidate.
But SMAPE lacks interpretability and has a high skewness.

Together with SMAPE we suggest using the Seasonal MASE because it seems to be the
state-of-the-art error metric for multiple time series forecasting.

Because we use both MASE and SMAPE we can combine them to one score, like
they do in the M4 competition.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:OWA}
  OWA = \frac{1}{2} \frac{MASE}{MASE_{\text{naive}}} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{SMAPE}{SMAPE_{\text{naive}}}
\end{equation}
