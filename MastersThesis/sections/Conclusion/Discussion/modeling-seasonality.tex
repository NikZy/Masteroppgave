\subsection{Modeling seasonality}
Our empirical results indicates that LSTMs have trouble modeling early seasonality.
The dataset with the least yearly seasonality is dataset 1. This is the only dataset where
the univariate LSTM outperformed SARIMA. However when feeding the LSTM with additional
data such as day of the week, month, and season, it became significantly better on datasets
on time series with high yearly seasonality.

%% Globale metoder gjør det bedre enn locale på MASE, men dårligere på sMAPE
% Kan det være fordi sMAPE straffer under predictions hardere enn 
% over predictions? TODO: Kjøre eksperiment på nytt for å få figures.
