\subsection{Which datasets did we get poor results on and why?}
Low mase seems to correlate with a low autocorr.
High smape seem to correlate with early seasonality.

It seems much harder to predict december.
There is a correlation around 0.28 between a categorys MASE metric
and it's autocorrelation coefficient.
