\label{section:Discussion:Discussion}


This section presents the underlying discussion creating the basis for the model framework proposed in \Cref{section:Architecture}.
The discussion concerns the current state of time-series prediction, the motivation behind the method selection, model structure, and the selected error metric.
This section intendeds to answer the research questions proposed in this paper,
as well as the reason behind the framework.

\section{LSTM trend and seasonality}
\begin{itemize}
  \item LSTM and ARIAM seem to have trouble with datasets with yearly seasonalities
  \item {LSTM will perform significantly better on these datasets if additional
        a multivariate version is used with additional information about date}
  \item {If date is not available then detrending the dataset using differencing is a good second alternative}
\end{itemize}
