\label{sections:Introduction:Structure}

This thesis introduces a lot of different theories and subjects,
thus a clear structure is required.
Chapter 2 introduces the underlying theory of the most important concepts presented in this thesis,
ranging from time-series prediction to deep learning methods and concepts.
Chapter 3 introduces work related to our problem-space, creating the theoretical basis for achieving our proposed goal and research questions.
This chapter focuses on current state-of-the-art methods,
as well as new proposed frameworks and methods relevant to our solution.
Chapter 5 discusses the available data for the project, presenting data analysis, filtering and pre-processing.
Afterward, chapter 5 describes the proposed model for this project, as well as state-of-the-art models and models designed and used for creating a baseline.
Chapter 6 describes the methodology used when conducting the experiments and implementation of the model and baselines,
before Chapter 7 presents the results achieved after the method implementation.
Lastly, Chapter 8 contains the discussion part of the thesis, discussing the model selection, used methodology, results and possible sources for errors,
before it concludes and summarizes the key findings in the thesis.
