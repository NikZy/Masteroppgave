% What is the aim of the thesis? What is it intended to solve?
% Contribute to state of the art
% Propose new method for e-commerce, and test ot on a dataset
% Assess the new method agains current state of the art methods found with literature search
% We evaluate current state of the art models, then use these to compare against our own model

The main focus of this thesis is to assess current state-of-the-art time series prediction in E-commerce forecasting,
and make a comparison with a new state-of-the-art predictive method.
Contributing to state of the art,
we propose the use of a new predictive method in E-commerce forecasting.
Introducing a predictive method that has yet to be applied in an E-commerce setting,
we evaluate this new method against proven predictive methods that is currently considered state-of-the-art.

The main contributions of this thesis is:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\it To To evaluate and compare current methods of time-series prediction on E-commerce forecasting.}
  \item {\it Formulate a framework for achieving higher predictive accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods on our problem space.}
  \item {\it Compare current state-of-the-art methods against a new predictive model to evaluate predictive ability.}
\end{enumerate}

The main focus of this work is to assess the current state of time-series prediction in E-commerce forecasting.
Contributing to the current state of the art,
we propose a method for increasing the predictive ability of time-series forecasting
assessing interest trends of e-commerce product categories.
