\section{Day of the week formula}
\label{section:BT:day-of-the-week-formula}
The book \cite{Hale-Evans2006} has an algorithm which can be used to calculate
the day of the week from a date, for example 14.01.1996.
%\todo[inline]{Move to B&T}
\begin{equation}
  day\_of\_the\_week
  = (YC + MC + CC + DC - LYC) \mod{7}
  \label{eq:day_of_the_week}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item YC = Year code.
  \item MC = Month code.
  \item CC = Century code.
  \item DC = Date number.
  \item LYC = Leap year code.
\end{itemize}

The year code is calculated using
$YC = (YY + (YY)/4) \mod{7}$, where $YY$ is the last
two digits of the year. For the year 1996, $YY = 96$.

The \textit{Month Code} is derived from \Cref{table:month_codes}.
The date number \textit{DC} is just what day of the month it is.

The century code \textit{CC} is 4. The leap year code \textit{LYC} is 1 the
month is january or february of a leap year.
