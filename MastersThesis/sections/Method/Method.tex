\chapter{Method}
\label{cha:Method}

With the aim of implementation and evaluation of a new predictive method,

This chapter introduces the implemented method and methodology used in the practical research of time series prediction.
Initially, section \Cref{section:Method:Arima} and \Cref{section:Method:LSTM} presents the use and tuning of baseline methods needed in order to validate our method.
