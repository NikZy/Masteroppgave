\chapter{Method}
\label{section:Method}

The applied methodology used in this paper is explored in this chapter.
\cref{section:Method:Hardware&Software} start with presenting the hardware used for running the experiments.
\cref{section:Method:Metrics} then presents the error metrics used to measure the accuracy of the predictions across models.
Running experiments are done through the use of the framework developed. This framework is explored in more detail in \cref{section:method:experiment-framework}.
This is extended through \cref{section:method:pytorch-vs-keras} exploring the selection of the machine learning framework Kerase and Tensorflow for this project.

Data processing steps used to manipulate data before the use with models are presented in \cref{section:Method:Preprocessing}.

Lastly, the model methods are defined, exploring the methods used with the SARIMA model \cref{section:Method:SARIMA}, the LSTM model \cref{section:Method:LSTM},
and the hybrid model CNN-AE and LSTM \cref{section:Method:CNN-AE-LSTM}.
