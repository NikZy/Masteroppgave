The t-test is used as a statistical measure of significance in predictions between different predictive models.
By using the error metric values produced by the predictive models,
the student t-test is used in order to verify using a null hypothesis
whether or not the predictions made by two different models are significantly different.

The error value of each time series per dataset is extracted after the experiments are executed.
These results are then aggregated in lists of error values.
A list is created per predictive model.
The lists can then be compared using the t-test \Cref*{section:BT:t-statistic-test},
testing for a significant difference between two and two lists of error metrics from different models.

The results from the t-test can then be used as a measure to evaluate if two model predictions were made on the same dataset
is of significant difference.
