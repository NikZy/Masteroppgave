\section{SARIMA baseline}
\label{section:Method:SARIMA}

The SARIMA model is the first model to create baseline metrics for comparisons with other models.
The SARIMA model is limited to being a local and univariate method,
thus limiting the number of experiments that can be run.

Due to the inherent seasonal component present in the e-commerce data available in this thesis,
the seasonal SARIMA model is selected in favor of the non-seasonal ARIMA model.

The SARIMA parameter values are shown in
\todo[inline]{Add SARIMA parameter values. Same as done in the LSTM method section.}

\subsection{SARIMA Tuning}
Model tuning of the SARIMA model is done with the auto-arima framework.
Auto-arima utilizes Bayesian optimization to find a well-suited set of hyperparameters to use,
within a defined search space for parameters.
Using the MAE metric as a measure of performance, auto-arima search for a set of parameters for each individual time-series
in the datasets defined in \Cref{section:Data:Dataset}.
The parameter search space used during the tuning is defined in \Cref{table:method:arima-tuning} with the range of parameter values.

%   % Model
%   The first experiments conducted are done in order to create a SARIMA baseline.
%   The SARIMA model is used to make multi-step predictions that are going to be used as a reference for other models.

%   % Dataset
%   Using the datasets defined in \Cref{section:Data:Dataset} SARIMA models are created.
%   A model with a connected set of hyperparameters is selected for each of the time series in the 3 datasets used in this thesis.
%   Due to the inherent seasonality in the e-commerce data, as explored in \Cref{section:Data:DataAnalysis},
%   the SARIMA model is selected due to the seasonal component.
%   It is the addition of this seasonal component that warrants the use of the SARIMA model over the simpler ARIMA model.

%   % Error metrics
%   In order to measure the accuracy of the model's predictions, multiple error metrics are utilized.
%   Primarily, the measure of MASE is used in order to measure accuracy.
%   As presented in \Cref{section:BT:Loss}, the MASE metric is used to measure the predictive accuracy
%   compared to a naive forecast.
%   However, during tuning of the models the MAE error metric is used, as this is the basis for the MAPE metrics we wish to use as a measure.
%   Additionally, error metrics such as MSE, SMAPE, and MAPE are used to measure the accuracy of the completed models.

%   % Tuning
%   \subsection{Tuning Arima}
%   Model tuning of the SARIMA model is done with the auto-arima framework.
%   Auto-arima utilizes Bayesian optimization to find a well-suited set of hyperparameters to use,
%   within a defined search space for parameters.
%   Using the MAE metric as a measure of performance, auto arima search for a set of parameters for each individual time-series
%   in the datasets defined in \Cref{section:Data:Dataset}.
%   The parameter search space used during the tuning is defined in \Cref{table:method:arima-tuning} with the range of parameter values.

%   \begin{table}[h]
%     \centering
%     \caption{Parameter search space auto-arima, SARIMA tuning}

%     \begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|}\hline
%       Parameter & Min & Max \\ \hline
%       p         & 0   & 7   \\ \hline

%       S         & 12  & 12  \\ \hline
%     \end{tabular}
%   \end{table}


%   \subsection{Models}

%   After the tuning of each model, the recorded hyperparameters are used to create predictive models for each time series.
%   The models are then trained on the available training data, resulting in a trained model.
%   Each model is then used to make a 7-day prediction forward in time.
%   This 7-day prediction is then compared to the 7-day-ahead test-set used to measure the true predictive ability of the trained models.
%   These predictions are then used in order to measure the predictive error using the defined error metrics above.

% \iffalse
%   The SARIMA model is a univariate method only supporting predictions made on individual time-series.
%   A model is created for each of the time-series in the datasets defined in \Cref{section:Data:Dataset}.
%   The model is created with the intension of creating 7 day predictions.
%   Predictive accuracy is therefor measured based on the models 7 day predictions.

%   Experiments with the ARIMA model is done on each time-series in the datasets introduced in \Cref{section:Data:Dataset}.
%   A number of experiments are therefor ran on each time-series in both \textit{dataset 1} and \textit{dataset 2}.


%   \iffalse
%     ARIMA models are first tuned on each time-series in order to make predicitons.
%     The hyper-parmeters fond after the tuning is then used in order to created models capable of making predictions.
%     The model attempts to make a 7 day ahead prediction.
%     % TODO: Add more about the 7 day prediction?
%   \fi

%   \subsection{Tuning of parameters}
%   Hyper-parmeter tuning for ARIMA is done in two different ways.
%   The first one is through the parameter search method \textit{Grid search},
%   while the second approach used \textit{Bayesian optimization} with the \textit{auto\_arima} framework.

%   \subsubsection*{Grid search}
%   Using the parameter tuning method of the grid search, a well-suited ARIMA model is searched for.
%   Grid search is an excessive search method where each parameter composion is tested.
%   Each set of parameters is used to define a model, train it using the training dataset,
%   and then validate it against the validation set.
%   With the goal of making a 7-day prediction, a 7-day forecast is compared to the validation data,
%   so that the 7-day prediction error is measured.
%   The model with the best 7-day prediction resulted in the lowest validation error,
%   is then selected as the best model found after parameter tuning.
%   The prediction error is measured in each of the loss functions \textit{MAE, MSE, MASE and SMAPE}.

%   \subsubsection{Auto ARIMA}
%   The second method used for parameter tuning is the Auto ARIMA method from the \textit{pmdarima} python library.
%   %% TODO: Add "pmdarima" reference
%   This method utilizes Bayesian optimization for search in the search space for hyperparameters.
%   Evaluating models using cross-validation and error metrics such as the "MSE",
%   the auto\_arima method finds a well-suited hyperparameter set in a fraction of the time used by the exhaustive grid search.

%   \subsection{Trained models}
%   When the models are tuned through Grid search and auto\_arima,
%   the searched hyperparameters are applied to models in order to run predictions.
%   While the tuning trains the ARIMA model on the training data, while validating it on the validation data,
%   it still runs the risk of overfitting the model.
%   The tuning may select a model with such high complexity that while it fits the validation data well,
%   but do not generalize enough to be usable on an unseen test set.
%   The tuned models are therefore trained using both the training data and validation data for training,
%   before it is used to predict the next 7 values coinciding with the test set.
%   The predictive capability of the resulting models serves as a benchmark for the actual prediction
%   of unknown data as it is not possible to tune models on data that have not yet been recorded.
%   Therefore, this is the true measure of the predictive capability of the ARIMA model.


%   \subsection{Expected results}

%   Using the ARIMA model for creating a 7-day multi-step ahead prediction is not expected to yield very good results.
%   The ARIMA model has problems with data where there is high volatility in the data, with a high standard variation.
%   The data available, as described in \Cref{section:Data:DataAnalysis},
%   is highly volatile and thus makes the predictions more difficult for the ARIMA model.

%   We expect the model to show the underlying trends in the dataset, but to
%   undershoot its predictions.
%   It is also expected that the ARIMA model is going to have a larger problem with making predictions on data with high seasonality.
%   Because of this, the SARIMA model will also serve as a baseline.


%   \section{Experiment 2 - SARIMA baselin}
%   \label{section:Method:Experiment2}

%   The second experiment conducted is done with the SARIMA model.
%   Just like the ARIMA model from experiment 1, the SARIMA model is used on the datasets defined in \Cref{section:Data:Dataset}.
%   Experiment 2 shares the same method for tuning the model as in experiment 1,
%   as well as using the same method for evaluating the tuned models.
%   Se experiment 1 for reference \Cref{section:Method:Experiment1}.

%   \subsection{Expected results}
%   As with the ARIMA model, the SARIMA is not expected to yield great results either as it suffers from the same problems as the ARIMA model.
%   However, the SARIMA model is expected to be an improvement to the ARIMA model for data with high seasonality.

%   With the available data, seasonality differs from dataset to dataset. While some time series have a high seasonal component,
%   others have little to no seasonality.
%   The SARIMA model is therefore only expected to outperform the ARIMA model on time-series with seasonality.
