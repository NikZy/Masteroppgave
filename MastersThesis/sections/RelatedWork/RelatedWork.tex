\chapter{Related work}
\label{section:RelatedWork}

In order to find a fitting solution to the goal proposed in \Cref{section:Introduction:Goal} and its related research questions,
we need to assess what advances have been accomplished within the problem space.
We assess state-of-the-art methods in time series prediction and loss functions.
With this, we are able to compare current solutions and methodology in order to answer our research questions.

This chapter starts with \Cref{section:RelatedWork:forecasting-ecommerce} introducing current and previous advances within E-commerce time series forecasting.
\Cref{section:RelatedWork:Statistical-NN} explores the use of deep learning method in comparison with statistical methods.
Later, \Cref{section:RelatedWork:Model-structure} introduces the use of global and local methods, as well as univariate and multivariate methods.
\Cref{section:RelatedWork:Hybrid} introduces current state-of-the-art hybrid methods for forecasting.
Multi-step ahead predictions are pressented in \Cref{section:RelatedWork:multi-step-ahead},
before a critique of LSTM usage in literature is given in \Cref*{section:RelatedWork:Criticue}.

Lastly, selected literature from the \textit{Related work} section, which creates the basis for further experimentation and methods,
 are presented in \Cref{section:RelatedWork:SelectedLiterature}.
