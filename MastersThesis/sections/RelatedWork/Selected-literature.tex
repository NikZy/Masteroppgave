\section{Selected Literature}

% What is used in this paper?
This chapter has introduced multiple theoretical sources of information
presenting the theoretical influences for this master's thesis.

The paper by \cite{Zhao2019} serves as the inspiration for the use of the CNN-AE-LSTM model
in this thesis.
Influenced by \cite{Zhao2019} and \cite{Cerqueira2019} the ARIMA/SARIMA model, along with the local univariate LSTM model
is used as baseline models in this paper.
As we have seen from \cite{Cerqueira2019}, the use of neural network models is preferred when the amount of data is sufficient,
and we can therefore assume the use of new neural network models is preferred.

Additionaly, \cite{Montero-Manso2021}, \cite{Bandara2017}, \cite{Laptev} inspire exploration of new model structures for
LSTM and CNN-AE-LSTM models.
\cite{Montero-Manso2021} and \cite{Bandara2017} discuss improvements achieved through use of global models,
while \cite{Laptev} suggests the use of multi-feature multivariate models for improved performance.

For use with such model structures, \cite{Bandara2017} also suggests the use of groupings of data,
which in turn serve as inspiration for grouping of time-series into datasets for experimentation.

These papers are some of the papers discussed, which serve as inspiration for the research conducted in this master's thesis.
