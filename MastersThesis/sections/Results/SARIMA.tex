% Tuning
The SARIMA models are tuned with auto-arima from the pmdarima library as described in \cref{section:Method:SARIMA}.
After tuning is conducted, the model parameters shown in table TODO is found.
\todo[inline]{Insert table of selected hyper parameters}
The found sets of hyperparameters are used to create SARIMA models used to make baseline predictions.


% Prediction results
With the found model parmeters, SARIMA models are created.
The models are trained before they are tasked to make a 7 day prediction.
Results from experiments run on each of the datasets can be found in tables
\cref{table:results:SARIMA:dataset1} and \cref{table:results:SARIMA:dataset2}.
