\section{Additional Experiments Results}
\label{section:Results:AdditionalExperimentResults}
The results of our two additional experiments are shown in \Cref{table:Average-metric-dataset-variance}.
The table shows the average metrics for all the time series in the dataset described in the name.
For example: \textit{dataset-high-variance-lstm-local-univariate} row show the average
results for the local univariate LSTM on the high variance dataset.
It got MASE of $0.645$ and a smape of $0.864$. The CNN-AE-LSTM (\textit{dataset-high-variance-cnn-ae-lstm-local-unviariate}) outperforms the LSTM on
the same dataset with a sMAPE of $0.832$ and a mase of $0.634$, which is a sMAPE reduction of $3.7\%$

The CNN-AE-LSTM performs much worse than the LSTM on the low variance dataset,
whit a sMAPE of $0.641$ versus $0.421$, and a MASE of $5.072$ versus $3.740$.
This is a $33.3\%$ decreased sMAPE perfomance and a $26.3\%$ MASE reduction.

On the medium variance dataset the CNN-AE-LSTM performs marginally better than the LSTM
with a sMAPE of $0.501$ versus $0.502$. Both models score the same MASE of $0.788$, but the
CNN-AE-LSTM achieves a $1.32\%$ better 7-day MASE.

Comparing the local univariate LSTM with differencing done as a pre-processing step
on the seasonal dataset in \Cref{table:Average-metric-dataset-variance},
with the same model type, without differencing in \Cref{table:Average-metric-dataset-seasonal}
from \Cref{section:discussion&results:experiment-results}:
the original local univariate LSTM model without differencing scored a MASE of
$2.207$, a sMAPE of $0.488$, and a 7-day MASE of $1.345$.
The model with differencing scored a MASE of $1.866$, a sMAPE of $0.367$ and a 7-day MASE of
$0.916$. That is an improvement of $15.45\%$, $24.80\%$, and $31.90\%$ respectively.
