\subsection{LSTM Baseline}
% TODO
% Using a different versions of this. Local univariate and mulitvariate, global univariate and multivariate
% Descibing the basic architecture of the different LSTM-s.
% Is there a large difference in LSTM design between the different types of LSTM?
% Describe tuning of the model? Or that is should or can be tuned?

The LSTM model is described in \cref{section:BT:LSTM}, and is the current state of the art method for making time series predictions.
Comparing new models agains the current state of the art models serves as a good measure for weither or not the new models is usefull.

\subsection{Global and local methods}
Unline the ARIMA and SARIMA models serving as the first baseline,
the LSTM model is able to work both as a local and a global methods.

First a local model is created. This can be directly compared agains the ARIMA model described in the previous section.
This model only use one time series as data for training, validation and testing, similar to the ARIMA model.

However, the LSTM model differs vastly from the ARIMA model in that it is able to be used as a global model.
Unlike the local method using only one time series for training and testing,
a global model is able to use multiple time series.
Using a set of time-series both for training, validation and testing,
the LSTM should be able to increase the predictive ability and accuracy by increasing the ammount of data available.
Additonaly, the use of a global model enables the LSTM to extract features from different time-series that hopefully can be used to make more accurate predictions on the original dataset.

\subsection{Univariate and Multivariate}
The LSTM model is configurable as both a univariate and a multivariate model.
While the univariate model only uses one input variable per time-step, a multivariate model takes multiple inputs for each time-step.
For seasonal data, one could then extract information from the dataset, adding multiple new values per time-step in order to encode information such as season or month.
