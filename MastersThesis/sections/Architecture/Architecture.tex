\chapter{Architecture/Model*}
\label{section:Architecture}

In this section, we propose a framework architecture intended to solve the goal presented in \Cref{section:Introduction:Goal}.
The model composition and selection of tuning methods are presented for each of the models that are used.
\Cref{section:Architecture:Baselines:Arima} starts with presenting the SARIMA model, the initial predictive baseline,
before the LSTM model is presented in \Cref{section:Architecture:Baselines:LSTM}.
Lastly, \Cref{section:Architecture:Model} presents the model design of the convolutional autoencoder used in the
convolutional autoencoder and LSTM model.
