\section*{Preface}



\vspace{1cm}

This work is done as part of the master thesis. Some chapters have earlier been submitted and graded
as part of the fall project in \cite{Sivertsen2021}.
The previously written sections are most of
\textit{Related Work [\Cref*{section:RelatedWork}]} and \textit{Architecture/Model [\Cref{section:Architecture}]}.
Some sections we have expanded, these include \textit{Introduction [\Cref{cha:Introduction}] } and
\textit{Background [\Cref*{section:BT:BackgroundTheory}]}.
To avoid misconceptions we have marked chapters that contain no new
information with \textit{*}.


We wish to thank our supervisor Anders Kofod-Petersen for his help and valuable feedback during this project.
Additionally, we would like to thank ``Prisguiden.no'' for their help and cooperation,
as well as for the dataset and this intriguing project.

All of the code are open and available at [Github \cite{githubSource}]. The dataset used is not available.
