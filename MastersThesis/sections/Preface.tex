This work is done as part of the master thesis.
Some of the sections in this thesis have been submitted and graded
as part of the fall project in \cite{Sivertsen2021}.
Previously written sections primarily consists of most of
\textit{Related Work [\Cref*{section:RelatedWork}]} and \textit{Architecture/Model [\Cref{section:Architecture}]}.
However, some alterations have been done to the sections.
Additionly, some sections have been extensivly expanded opon.
This includes \textit{Introduction [\Cref{cha:Introduction}] } and
\textit{Background [\Cref*{section:BT:BackgroundTheory}]}.
To avoid misconceptions we have marked chapters that contain no new
information with \textit{*}.


All of the code are open and available at [Github \cite{githubSource}]. The dataset used is not available.
