\section*{Preface}



\vspace{1cm}

This work is done as part of the author's masters thesis,
and is an extension to the work done in \cite{Sivertsen2021}.

Some sections of this thesis have earlier been submitted and graded
as part of the fall project in \cite{Sivertsen2021}.
Others have been improved and extensively altered as part of this thesis.

Previously written sections consist of large parts of \textit{Background and Theory [\Cref*{cha:TheoryAndBackground}]},
and \textit{Related work [\Cref*{section:RelatedWork}]}, and \Cref*{section:Data:DataExploration}.
However, multiple sections are updated and added to the chapters.
To avoid misconceptions we have marked chapters that contain no new
information with \textit{*}.

Additionally, multiple sections have been extensively updated as part of this masters thesis.
These include \textit{Introduction [\Cref*{cha:Introduction}]}, as well as \Cref*{section:Architecture:Model}.


All of the code are open and available at [Github \cite{githubSource}]. The dataset used is not available.
