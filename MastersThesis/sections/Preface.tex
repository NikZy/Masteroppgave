\section*{Preface}



\vspace{1cm}

This master's thesis is an extension of the work conducted as part of a fall project \cref{...},
creating a basis for further work conducted in this thesis.
% This work is done as part of the master thesis.
% Some chapters har earlier been submitted and graded as part of the fall project.
The previously written sections are most of
\textit{Related Work [\Cref*{section:RelatedWork}]} and \textit{Architecture/Model [\Cref{section:Architecture}]}.
Some sections have we expanded, these include \textit{Introduction [\Cref{cha:Introduction}] } and
\textit{Background [\Cref*{section:BT:BackgroundTheory}]}.
To avoid misconceptions we have marked chapters that contain no new
information with \textit{*}.

We wish to thank our supervisor Anders Kofod-Petersen for his help and valuable feedback during this project.
Additionally, we would like to thank 'Prisguiden' for their help and cooperation,
as well as for the dataset and this intriguing project.

All of the code are open and available at [Github \cite{githubSource}]. The dataset used is not available.
