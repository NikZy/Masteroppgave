abstract = {Many time series data are characterized by strong randomness and high noise.The traditional predictive model is difficult to extract the characteristics of the data, and the prediction effect is not very good. Convolutional neural networks and autoencoder have a good effect on extracting data features. Combining these two techniques, a predictive model of a combination of convolutional autoencoder(CAE) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to predict time-series data with high noise. First, a one-dimensional convolution is used in the encoding and decoding network of the autoEncoder to extract data features and then use Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to predict. The experimental results show that the prediction error of convolutional autoEncoder-Long Short Term Memory (CAE and LSTM) model is significantly lower than other models.},

@article{Guen2019,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of time series forecasting for
non-stationary signals and multiple future steps prediction. To handle this
challenging task, we introduce DILATE (DIstortion Loss including shApe and
TimE), a new objective function for training deep neural networks. DILATE aims
at accurately predicting sudden changes, and explicitly incorporates two terms
supporting precise shape and temporal change detection. We introduce a
differentiable loss function suitable for training deep neural nets, and
provide a custom back-prop implementation for speeding up optimization. We also
introduce a variant of DILATE, which provides a smooth generalization of
temporally-constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experiments carried out on
various non-stationary datasets reveal the very good behaviour of DILATE
compared to models trained with the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function, and also to DTW and variants. DILATE is also agnostic to the choice
of the model, and we highlight its benefit for training fully connected
networks as well as specialized recurrent architectures, showing its capacity
to improve over state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting approaches.},

We provide the following contributions that help understand the potential and applicability of global methods and how they relate to traditional local methods that fit a separate forecasting method to each series: • Global and local methods can produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the series in the set. • The complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains constant for global methods. This result supports the recent evidence and provides principles for the design of new algorithms. • In an extensive empirical study, we show that purposely na{\"{i}}ve algorithms derived from these principles show outstanding accuracy. In particular, global linear models provide competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters than the simplest of local methods.},

@article{Rabanser2020,
abstract = {Time series modeling techniques based on deep learning have seen many advancements in recent years, especially in data-abundant settings and with the central aim of learning global models that can extract patterns across multiple time series. While the crucial importance of appropriate data pre-processing and scaling has often been noted in prior work, most studies focus on improving model architectures. In this paper we empirically investigate the effect of data input and output transformations on the predictive performance of several neural forecasting architectures. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of several forms of data binning, i.e. converting real-valued time series into categorical ones, when combined with feed-forward, recurrent neural networks, and convolution-based sequence models. In many non-forecasting applications where these models have been very successful, the model inputs and outputs are categorical (e.g. words from a fixed vocabulary in natural language processing applications or quantized pixel color intensities in computer vision). For forecasting applications, where the time series are typically real-valued, various ad-hoc data transformations have been proposed, but have not been systematically compared. To remedy this, we evaluate the forecasting accuracy of instances of the aforementioned model classes when combined with different types of data scaling and binning. We find that binning almost always improves performance (compared to using normalized real-valued inputs), but that the particular type of binning chosen is of lesser importance.},

abstract = {In order to prevent merchants from occupying a large amount of cash flow due to unreasonable replenishment and the waste of resources and loss of profits caused by goods in short supply, a reasonable forecast of sales volume is particularly important. This article used the ARIMA-BP nonlinear combination model to predict the sale of merchants' goods. Two separate prediction models, the BP neural network and the ARIMA, were used to predict the sales volume in the next 5 days, and then a mean square error model was established to weight the fitting and predictive results of the two single predictions. The weight obtained is brought into the BP neural network model for training, and one is obtained The dynamic weight model is used to predict the dynamic weight of two single prediction models in the next five days. Finally, the test data was substituted into the model, and the normalized error is 0.05363. The research shows that the model can adapt to the problem of forecasting the sales volume of e-commerce goods, more stable, and the error of the combined prediction is much smaller than a single prediction.},

abstract = {Due to industrialization and the rising demand for energy, global energy consumption has been rapidly increasing. Recent studies show that the biggest portion of energy is consumed in residential buildings, i.e., in European Union countries up to 40{\%} of the total energy is consumed by households. Most residential buildings and industrial zones are equipped with smart sensors such as metering electric sensors, that are inadequately utilized for better energy management. In this paper, we develop a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) with an long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE) model for future energy prediction in residential and commercial buildings. The central focus of this research work is to utilize the smart meters' data for energy forecasting in order to enable appropriate energy management in buildings. We performed extensive research using several deep learning-based forecasting models and proposed an optimal hybrid CNN with the LSTM-AE model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate the aforementioned models under the umbrella of a unified framework with some utility preprocessing. Initially, the CNN model extracts features from the input data, which are then fed to the LSTM-encoder to generate encoded sequences. The encoded sequences are decoded by another following LSTM-decoder to advance it to the final dense layer for energy prediction. The experimental results using different evaluation metrics show that the proposed hybrid model works well. Also, it records the smallest value for mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) when compared to other state-of-the-art forecasting methods over the UCI residential building dataset. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on Korean commercial building data and the results indicate that our proposed hybrid model is a worthy contribution to energy forecasting.},

abstract = {Generating accurate and reliable sales forecasts is crucial in the E-commerce business. The current state-of-the-art techniques are typically univariate methods, which produce forecasts considering only the historical sales data of a single product. However, in a situation where large quantities of related time series are available, conditioning the forecast of an individual time series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial. Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a unified model. We achieve this by globally training a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that exploits the non-linear demand relationships available in an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. Aside from the forecasting framework, we also propose a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome the challenges in the E-commerce business. We also introduce several product grouping strategies to supplement the LSTM learning schemes, in situations where sales patterns in a product portfolio are disparate. We empirically evaluate the proposed forecasting framework on a real-world online marketplace dataset from Walmart.com. Our method achieves competitive results on category level and super-departmental level datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.},

The Prophet model which decomposes trend, season, and holiday and the machine learning model-lightGBM model-are used to train and test Walmart supermarket sales data from 2011-01-29 to 2016-06-19, and use data from 2016-06-19 to 2016-08-14 to make prediction and empirical analysis. The results suggest that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the Prophet model and the LightLGB model are 0.694 and 0.617, respectively, indicating that the machine learning model performs well in the sales forecast of retail stores.

After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward.

abstract = {Time series prediction is an intensively studied topic in data mining. In spite of the considerable improvements, recent deep learning-based methods overlook the existence of extreme events, which result in weak performance when applying them to real time series. Extreme events are rare and random, but do play a critical role in many real applications, such as the forecasting of financial crisis and natural disasters. In this paper, we explore the central theme of improving the ability of deep learning on modeling extreme events for time series prediction. Through the lens of formal analysis, we first find that the weakness of deep learning methods roots in the conventional form of quadratic loss. To address this issue, we take inspirations from the Extreme Value Theory, developing a new form of loss called Extreme Value Loss (EVL) for detecting the future occurrence of extreme events. Furthermore, we propose to employ Memory Network in order to memorize extreme events in historical records. By incorporating EVL with an adapted memory network module, we achieve an end-to-end framework for time series prediction with extreme events. Through extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real datasets of stock and climate, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our framework. Besides, we also provide a proper choice for hyper-parameters in our proposed framework by conducting several additional experiments.},

abstract = {Forecasting future sales is one of the most important issues that is beyond all strategic and planning decisions in effective operations of retail businesses. For profitable retail businesses, accurate demand forecasting is crucial in organizing and planning production, purchasing, transportation and labor force. Retail sales series belong to a special type of time series that typically contain trend and seasonal patterns, presenting challenges in developing effective forecasting models. This work compares the forecasting performance of state space models and ARIMA models. The forecasting performance is demonstrated through a case study of retail sales of five different categories of women footwear: Boots, Booties, Flats, Sandals and Shoes. On both methodologies the model with the minimum value of Akaike's Information Criteria for the in-sample period was selected from all admissible models for further evaluation in the out-of-sample. Both one-step and multiple-step forecasts were produced. The results show that when an automatic algorithm the overall out-of-sample forecasting performance of state space and ARIMA models evaluated via RMSE, MAE and MAPE is quite similar on both one-step and multi-step forecasts. We also conclude that state space and ARIMA produce coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal rates for both one-step and multi-step forecasts.},

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we
present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models
on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series
clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks,
a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on
benchmarking datasets under competition evaluation procedures. In particular,
in terms of mean sMAPE accuracy, it consistently outperforms the baseline LSTM
model and outperforms all other methods on the CIF2016 forecasting competition
dataset.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting is one of the most active research topics. Machine learning methods have been increasingly adopted to solve these predictive tasks. However, in a recent work, these were shown to systematically present a lower predictive performance relative to simple statistical methods. In this work, we counter these results. We show that these are only valid under an extremely low sample size. Using a learning curve method, our results suggest that machine learning methods improve their relative predictive performance as the sample size grows. The code to reproduce the experiments is available at https://github.com/vcerqueira/MLforForecasting.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to design a model that can accurately forecast the supply chain sales. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposed a new model based on lightGBM and LSTM to forecast the supply chain sales. In order to verify the accuracy and efficiency of this model, three representative supply chain sales data sets are selected for experiments. Findings: The experimental results show that the combined model can forecast supply chain sales with high accuracy, efficiency and interpretability. Practical implications: With the rapid development of big data and AI, using big data analysis and algorithm technology to accurately forecast the long-term sales of goods will provide the database for the supply chain and key technical support for enterprises to establish supply chain solutions. This paper provides an effective method for supply chain sales forecasting, which can help enterprises to scientifically and reasonably forecast long-term commodity sales. Originality/value: The proposed model not only inherits the ability of LSTM model to automatically mine high-level temporal features, but also has the advantages of lightGBM model, such as high efficiency, strong interpretability, which is suitable for industrial production environment.},
