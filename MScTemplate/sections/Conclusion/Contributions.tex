% Unclear what we have actually contributed
% Literal analysis of current state of the art time series prediction frameworks
% Literal analysis of current state of the art e-commerce predictive solutions
% Created a framework for imporving accuracy of predicitons on e-commerce with high variance
% Conduct literal analysis to support the propsed framework performance

With the aim of improving the predictive accuracy of time series data in an e-commerce setting,
this paper has conducted a theoretical study of the related theory.
By assessing previous and current solutions for time series forecasting, as well as current state-of-the-art time series prediction models in an e-commerce setting,
this paper has compared existing solutions in order to evaluate current models and improve these.
Contributing to the current methods by evaluating the relevance of new solutions in e-commerce prediction,
and the improvements of new solutions.
This solution is comprised of a hybrid method, as well as different model structures for global and local methods,
in order to utilize available data.
