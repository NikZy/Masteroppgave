\label{sections:Discussion:FutureWork}

% Future work involves several things
% - To create a benchmark on the dataset with ARIMA model
% - To actually test the proposed method framework
% - To evaluate if groupings of correlating data improve performance


% The propsed method in this paper is still not tested
% Is there any difference between global, local, univariate, multivariate methods?
% What is the ARIMA baseline on the available data?
% What error metrics and loss functions should be used to achieve the best accuracy?
% 

The aim of this paper was to investigate the current landscape and solutions for time series predictions as a whole,
as well as in an e-commerce setting.
Initially, the current predictive ability of solutions on an e-commerce setting was investigated.
This was then compared to the current state of the art methods for prediciton on time series data,
as well as current methods for grouping and analysing data.
The paper is primarily ....

Consider where you would like to extend this work. These extensions might either be continuing the ongoing direction or taking a side direction that became obvious during the work. Further, possible solutions to limitations in the work conducted, highlighted in ~\ref{sec:Discussion} may be presented.
