% Future work involves several things
% - To create a benchmark on the dataset with ARIMA model
% - To actually test the proposed method framework
% - To evaluate if groupings of correlating data improve performance

Consider where you would like to extend this work. These extensions might either be continuing the ongoing direction or taking a side direction that became obvious during the work. Further, possible solutions to limitations in the work conducted, highlighted in ~\ref{sec:Discussion} may be presented.
