\label{sections:Discussion:FutureWork}

% Future work involves several things
% - To create a benchmark on the dataset with ARIMA model
% - To actually test the proposed method framework
% - To evaluate if groupings of correlating data improve performance


% The propsed method in this paper is still not tested
% Is there any difference between global, local, univariate, multivariate methods?
% What is the ARIMA baseline on the available data?
% What error metrics and loss functions should be used to achieve the best accuracy?
% 

The aim of this paper was to investigate the current landscape and solutions for time-series predictions as a whole,
as well as in an e-commerce setting.
Initially, the current predictive ability of solutions in an e-commerce setting was investigated.
It is then compared to the current state-of-the-art methods for prediction on time series data,
as well as current methods for grouping and analyzing time-series data.
The paper focuses on a theoretical approach to solving the proposed research questions,
excluding practical experiments.

Work remains on conducting practical experiments on the time series data supplied by Prisguiden,
in order to make time-series predictions on user trends.
This includes, but is not limited to, creating a predictive baseline using statistical models, such as the ARIMA method, a deep learning baseline such as an LSTM,
as well as implementing the framework proposed in \Cref{section:Architecture}.
In addition, practical experiments on the use of a local or global method with the available data,
as well as the use of a univariate or multivariate method.
