The goal of this paper is to propose a method for achieving accurate time-series predictions in an e-commerce
problem space using a hybrid CNN-AE and LSTM method.
In order to achieve this goal, relevant research questions were presented.
Conducting a structured literature analysis of the current status of time series prediction,
this paper aims at answering the proposed research questions.

Initially, research questions 1 through 3 is addressed.
Conducting a literature review, current time series prediction methods are uncovered and compared.
Related work is discussed and reviewed in order to find ways to improve current solutions.
A predictive model is proposed with the aim of solving the goal presented.
This Convolutional autoencoder and LSTM hybrid model is propsed as a method for exploring the goal pressented.
The design is influenced by the state-of-the-art methods explored through attempting to answer the research questions.
With methods and approaches addressing the what is missing from current e-commerce prediction methods,
such as utilization of correlated time series, the method aims to address the goal through the use of the research questions.
 

The paper does not explore the propsed model by practical experimentation,
thus answering research questions 4 and 5 is not explored.
These research questions are addressed as points of future work in regards to
practical experimentation with the propsed method within the problem space.
