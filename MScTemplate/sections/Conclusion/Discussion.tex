\label{section:Discussion:Discussion}

% Discuss what we have found of related work and the proposed framework / method
% Discuss all the different parts of the framework that is proposed
% Discuss the implications of such a method and why it makes sense to use this method on our data / problem space

% Write a discussion introdicion for the rest of the introduction
% Incorporate related work discussion, but relate different parts of the related work sections.

This section presents the underlying discussion creating the basis for the model framework proposed in chapter \ref{section:Architecture}.
The discussion concerns the current state of time series prediction, the motivation behind the method selection, model structure, and the selected error metric.
This section intendeds to answer the proposed research questions proposed in this paper,
as well as the reason behind the proposed framework.
