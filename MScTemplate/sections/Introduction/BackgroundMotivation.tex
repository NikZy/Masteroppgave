Having a template to work from provides a starting point. However, for a given project, a slight variation in the template may be required due to the nature of the given project. Further, the order in which the various chapters and sections will be written will also vary from project to project but will seldom start at the abstract and sequentially follow the chapters of the report. One critical reason for this, is that you need to start writing as early as possible and you will begin to write up where you are currently focusing. However, do not leave the abstract until the end. The abstract is the first thing anyone reads of an article or thesis --- after the title; and thus it is important that it is very well written. Abstracts are hard to write so create revisions throughout the course of your project as your project progresses.  

This introduction to background and motivation should state where this project is situated in the field and what the key driving forces motivating this research are. However, keep this section brief as it is still part of the introduction. The motivation will be further extended in chapter~\ref{T-B}, presenting your complete state-of-the-art. 

Note that this template uses italics to highlight where latin wording is inserted to represent text and the text of the template that we wish to draw your attention to. The italics themself are not an indication that such sections should use italics.
