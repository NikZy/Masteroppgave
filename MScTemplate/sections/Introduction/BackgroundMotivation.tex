With the emergence of the internet, large parts of the human experience are conducted online.
Online services supply users with everything from entertainment and social media to banking and online shopping.
The accessibility of online services such as online retailers has enabled users to shop for most products online.
With online shopping, competitive pricing emerged.
When shopping online, a user will often consider the product's pricing before completing a purchase, often comparing the retail prices between different retailers.


In order to easily and effectively compare prices of products amongst retailers,
\textit{Prisguiden} was created.
Products and product categories were introduced to the site, collecting the pricing information of the products from several different retailers.
% Different product categories have different retailers, and thus the collection of the information is somewhat distributed.
When new products hit the market, these products are introduced to the product portfolio in order for uses to compare the prices.
Operating such an online service has enabled \textit{Prisguden} to accumulate user data such as product and product category interest, and more.

The data regarding product user interests is currently unused, despite being collected for years.
The data is highly fluctuating and with high variance.
The collected time series data could hold relevant information currently unused.
\textit{Prisguiden} intend to use this data in order to predict future product and category trends.
With this information, they would effectively know where to allocate their resources regarding introducing and updating product listings and pricing for product categories.

% It has made it easies to compare prices.
% Prisguiden is thus able to collect a lot of data about what products and product categories are searched and thus popular
% This creates a time series of data

In order to make such time-series predictions, methods for time series forecasting are used.
Utilizing methods to evaluate historical data, the aim is to predict future values.
Several methods have therefore been introduced to achieve this.
