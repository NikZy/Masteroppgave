\section{Research Method}
\label{section:Introduction:research-method}

This paper approaches the goal and research questions through theoretical analysis
of the problem space.
Primarily the focus of this paper is to conduct a review and analysis of current literature.
Reviewing the current state-of-the-art methods for predictive analysis of time series,
as well as new experimental methods and frameworks.
Additionally, we review the current work done within the E-commerce sector attempting to predict sales and trends.
We argue that this problem space is similar to our proposed problem, and we thus use this as a benchmark in order to assess new solutions.
The literature review aims at reviewing the current state of time series prediction,
in order to best find a method to achieve our goal described above.
