\section{Research Method}
\label{section:Introduction:research-method}

This paper employs two different research methods.
Primarily the focus of this paper is to conduct a review and analysis of current litterature.
Reviewing the current state-of-the-art methods for predictive analysis of time series,
as well as new experimental methods and frameworks.
Additionally, we review the current work done within the E-commerce sector attempting to predict sales and trends.
We argue that this problem space is similar to our proposed problem, and we thus use this as a benchmark in order to assess new solutions.
The literature review aims at reviewing the current state of time series prediction,
in order to best find a method to achieve our goal described above.

In addition to the theoretical approach, we conduct practical tests on the problem space in order to achieve a benchmark.
Using the current state of the art statistical methods,
we assess the predictive capabilities of the old methods as well as the need for new ones.

What methodology will you apply to address the goals: theoretic/analytic, model/abstraction or design/experiment?
This section will describe the research methodology applied and the reason for this choice of research methodology.
