\label{sections:Introduction:Structure}

This paper introduces a lot of different theories and subjects,
thus a clear structure is required.
Chapter 2 introduces the underlying theory of the most important concepts presented in this paper,
ranging from time series prediction to deep learning methods and concepts.
Chapter 3 introduces work related to our problem-space, creating the theoretical basis for achieving our proposed goal and research questions.
This chapter focuses on current state-of-the-art methods,
as well as new proposed frameworks and methods relevant to our solution.
Chapter 4 introduces our proposed method and architecture,
presenting the model framework, appropriate error metrics, and model structure.
Lastly, chapter 5 supplies an evaluation and discussion of the proposed framework regarding our proposed research questions and goal.
