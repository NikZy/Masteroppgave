\label{sections:Introduction:Structure}

This paper introduces a lot of different theories and subjects,
thus a clear structure is required.
Chapter 2 introduces the underlying theory of the most important concepts introduced in this paper,
ranging from time series prediction to deep learning methods and concepts.
Chapter 3 introduces work related to our problem-space, creating the theoretical basis for achieving our proposed goal and research questions.
This chapter focuses on current state-of-the-art methods,
as well as new proposed frameworks and methods relevant to our solution.
Chapter 4 introduces our proposed method and architecture, as well as the statistical method used for creating a predictive baseline.
Chapter 5 describes the experimental setup and process before revealing the achieved results.
Lastly, chapter 6 supplies an evaluation and discussion of the proposed framework compared to previous work and our baseline.

This section provides the reader with an overview of what is coming in the next chapters.
You want to say more than what is explicit in the chapter name,
if possible, but still keep the description short and to the point.
