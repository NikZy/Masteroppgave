The main focus of this work is to assess the current state of time series prediction in E-commerce forecasting.
Contributing to the current state of the art,
we propose a method for increasing the predictive ability of time series forecasting
assessing interest trends of e-commerce product categories.
The main contributions of this paper are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\it Evaluating and comparing current methods of time series prediction on e-commerce.}
    \item {\it Evaluating and comparing current state-of-the-art methods for time series forecasting.}
    \item {\it Formulating a framework for achieving higher predictive accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods on our problem space.}
\end{enumerate}
