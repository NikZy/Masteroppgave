Online shopping platforms retain large amounts of product sales and interest data.
Despite this, it is not always easy to know what information this data might contain and what it could mean to exploit and analyze this data.
Analyzing product interest data or sales data could help retailers discover helpful information such as product trends or anomalies.
While methods for attaining such information already exists to some degree, in the form of simple statistical methods or neural networks,
there is still room for improvements.


This thesis will aim to propose a solution for predicting product trends using time series data of several product categories.
By doing this, the intent is to increase the predictive accuracy of the model by using grouped time series with varying correlations,
instead of only one series of data to which the statistical methods are limited.
