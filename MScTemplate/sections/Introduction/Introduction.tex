\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:Introduction}



All chapters should begin with an introduction before any sections begin. Further, each sections begins with an introduction before  subsections begin. Chapters with just one section or sections with just one sub-section, should be avoided. Think carefully about chapter and section titles as each title stand alone in the table of contents (without associated text) and should convey meaning for the contents of the chapter or section. 

In all chapters and sections it is important to write clearly and concisely. Avoid repetitions and if needed, refer back to the original discussion or presentation. Each new section, subsection or paragraph should provide the reader with new information and be written in your own words. Avoid direct quotes. If you use direct quotes, unless the quote itself is very significant, you are conveying to the reader that you are unable to express this discussion or fact yourself. Such direct quotes also break the flow of the language (yours to someone else's).   



\section{Background and Motivation}\label{cit}
\label{sec:BackgroundAndMotivation}

Having a template to work from provides a starting point. However, for a given project, a slight variation in the template may be required due to the nature of the given project. Further, the order in which the various chapters and sections will be written will also vary from project to project but will seldom start at the abstract and sequentially follow the chapters of the report. One critical reason for this, is that you need to start writing as early as possible and you will begin to write up where you are currently focusing. However, do not leave the abstract until the end. The abstract is the first thing anyone reads of an article or thesis --- after the title; and thus it is important that it is very well written. Abstracts are hard to write so create revisions throughout the course of your project as your project progresses.  

This introduction to background and motivation should state where this project is situated in the field and what the key driving forces motivating this research are. However, keep this section brief as it is still part of the introduction. The motivation will be further extended in chapter~\ref{T-B}, presenting your complete state-of-the-art. 

Note that this template uses italics to highlight where latin wording is inserted to represent text and the text of the template that we wish to draw your attention to. The italics themself are not an indication that such sections should use italics.

\section{Research Method}
\label{sec:researchMethod}

What methodology will you apply to address the goals: theoretic/analytic, model/abstraction or design/experiment? This section will describe the research methodology applied and the reason for this choice of research methodology.  

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:IntroContributions}

The main description of the contributions will come in chapter~\ref{cont} after the results are presented. This section just provides a brief summary of the main contributions of the work. This section can also be left out, leaving all discussions in chapter~\ref{cont}.

The format of this section will generally follow the following format:
{\it
Donec non turpis nec neque egestas faucibus nec id neque. Etiam consectetur, odio vitae gravida tempus, diam velit sagittis turpis, a molestie ligula tellus at nunc. Nam convallis consequat vestibulum. Proin dolor neque, dapibus a pellentesque a, commodo a nibh.}

\item {\it Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:thesisStructure}

This section provides the reader with an overview of what is coming in the next chapters. You want to say more than what is explicit in the chapter name, if possible, but still keep the description short and to the point.
