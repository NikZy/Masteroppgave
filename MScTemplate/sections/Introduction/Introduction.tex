\iffalse
  All chapters should begin with an introduction before any sections begin. Further, each sections begins with an introduction before  subsections begin. Chapters with just one section or sections with just one sub-section, should be avoided. Think carefully about chapter and section titles as each title stand alone in the table of contents (without associated text) and should convey meaning for the contents of the chapter or section.

  In all chapters and sections it is important to write clearly and concisely. Avoid repetitions and if needed, refer back to the original discussion or presentation. Each new section, subsection or paragraph should provide the reader with new information and be written in your own words. Avoid direct quotes. If you use direct quotes, unless the quote itself is very significant, you are conveying to the reader that you are unable to express this discussion or fact yourself. Such direct quotes also break the flow of the language (yours to someone else's).
