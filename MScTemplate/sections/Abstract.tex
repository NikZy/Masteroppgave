The E-commerce sector is heavily influenced by trends in user activity and purchase patterns.
'Prisguiden' is an online service created to compare product prices amongst retailers easily.
With this, the site can record the amount of user activity connected to a product or product category.
To improve their service, knowing product trends could help with resource allocation for what products and sites are listed in their system.
In order to predict such trends before they occur, a time-series prediction system could be utilized.

Time-series prediction in E-commerce sales has been attempted several times,
often solved by statistical models or deep learning methods.
Multiple approaches to time-series prediction are proposed in the related literature,
resulting in many different models and frameworks.

This study conducts an extensive structured literature review of the current state of times series prediction research, E-commerce forecasting,
and current state-of-the-art methods.
Subsequently, a hybrid deep neural network model is proposed to increase the predictive accuracy of E-commerce time-series forecasting.
Combining a convolutional autoencoder with an LSTM network, we discuss the predictive ability of the proposed model
and its architecture.
Combining this model with data preprocessing and grouping, we propose the creation of a global prediction framework,
grouping related time-series together.
