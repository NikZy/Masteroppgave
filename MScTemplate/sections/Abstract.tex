The e-commerce sector is heavily influenced by trends in user activity and trends.
'Prisguiden' is a online service created to easily compare prices of different products online.
With this, the site is able to record the ammount of user activity connected to a product or product category.
In able to imporve their service, knowing product trends could help with resource allocation for what products and sites are listed in their system.
To predict such trends before or as they occur, a time series prediction system could be utilized.

Time series prediction in e-commerce sales has been attempted several times,
ofthen solved by statistical models or deep learning using recurrent networks.
Multiple approaches to time series prediction is proposed in the related literature,
resulting in many different models and aproaches.

This study focus on the creation of a hybrid deep learning model in order to increase the predictive accuracy
of the time series forecasting.
Combining a convolutional autoencoder with a LSTM network, we discuss the predictive ability of this propsed model
and its architecture
To justify the proposed framework, a predictive baseline i created using ARIMA.
This baseline shows the need for more accurate predictive models,
resulting in the proposed hybrid model.
Combining this model with data preprosessing and grouping, we propse the creation of a global prediction framework,
grouping related time series together.

This paper provides a template for writing AI project rapports for either the AI specialization project; masters "datateknikk" or masters "informatikk". The use of the template is recommended and is written in english as we encourage students to submit their project and masters theses in English.
The template does not form a compulsory style that you are obliged to use. However, the format and contents are a result of a joint AI group initiative thus providing a common starting point for all AI students. For a given project tuning of the template may still be required. Such tuning might involve moving a chapter to a section or vice versa due to the nature of the project.

The abstract is your sales pitch which encourages people to read your work but unlike sales it should be realistic with respect to the contributions of the work. It should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the field of research
    \item a brief motivation for the work
    \item what the research topic is and
    \item the research approach(es) applied.
    \item contributions
\end{itemize}

The abstract length should be roughly half a page of text --- without lists, tables or figures.
