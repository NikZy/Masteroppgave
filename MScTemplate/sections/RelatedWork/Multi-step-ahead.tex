\section{Multi-step ahead}
\label{section:RelatedWork:multi-step-ahead}
We are interested in forecasting longer than one time step in the future.
As stated in \autoref{section:BT:forecasting-time-series} this is called a multi-step-ahead forecast.

\cite{Hewamalage2021} has section regarding multi-step-ahead forecasting.
They cite \cite{BenTaieb2011} works and their findings that
using a multip-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy is
advantagious over the recursive single-step-ahed. This is because the MIMO strategy
incoroporates the inter-dependencies between each time step, rather than forecasting
each time step in isolation. They also found that the MIMO strategy voids error
accumulation over the prediction time steps.
\cite{Ramos2015} findings also support the MIMO strategy over the recursive
single-step-ahead strategy.

\cite{Hewamalage2021} suggests that the best input-to-output size ratio
is $window\_input\_size = 1.25 * output\_window\_size$.
