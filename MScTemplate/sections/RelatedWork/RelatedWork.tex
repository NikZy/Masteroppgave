Our problem can be composed into two main categories.
time series forecasting, and e-commerce trend forecasting.
What is the characteristics of e-commerce trend forecasting?
The domain consists of multiple time series, some which correlate.
The time series contains multiple periods, for example users shop
online ofter on sundays than on mondays. 
Some categories are popular in the spring, others in the fall.
Mabye online shopping spikes around common paydays?

In order to find a fitting solution to the goal proposed in \ref{section:Introduction:Goal} and its related research questions,
we need to assess what advances have been accomplished within the problem space.
We assess state-of-the-art methods in time series prediction and loss functions.
With this, we are able to compare current solutions and methodology in order to answer our research questions.

This chapter starts with \autoref{section:RelatedWork:forecasting-ecommerce} introducing current and previous advances within e-commerce time series forecasting
\autoref{section:RelatedWork:Statistical-NN} explores the use of deep learning method in comparison with statistical methods.
Later, \autoref{section:RelatedWork:Model-structure} introduces the use of global and local methods, as well as univariate and multivariate methods.
\autoref{section:RelatedWork:Hybrid} introduces current state-of-the-art hybrid methods for forecasting.
Lastly, \autoref{section:RelatedWork:Loss} pressents loss functions discuss relevant loss functions and their usecases.
