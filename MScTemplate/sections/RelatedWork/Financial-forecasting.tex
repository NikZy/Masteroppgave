\section{Forecasting E-commerce}
\label{section:RelatedWork:forecasting-ecommerce}

User click rate on consumer e-commerce goods is a narrow domain,
and we are unable to find any research that has yet been done within this particular field.
However, one can argue that user interest in consumer goods follows the same distribution
as online retail sales.
Both domains will have the same seasonality with weekly and yearly periodic fluctuations.
Additionally, the domains contain the same kind of products and categories.
Both domains are dictated by the same external factors, such as media, commercials,
and trends.
Forecasting retail sales should translate well to e-commerce click rate.


\cite{Ramos2015} did a comparative study on exponential smoothing methods
based on state-space models such as ETS and ARIMA.
The aim was to measure the forecasting performance of the two modeling frameworks
when applied to retail sales data of five different categories,
containing univariate time series regarding sales of women's footwear.
The domain proved difficult due to strong trends and seasonal patterns.

% What are their results?
The models forecasting ability were evaluated through several loss functions, such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Both ETS and ARIMA achieved similar results with both one-step and multi-step forecasting.
Their results show that multi-step forecasts are generally more accurate.
This is argued to be a result of multistep to incorporate more up-to-date information.
%When an automatic algorithm is applied to the overall out-of-sample forecasting,
%the ARIMA models do not achieve better results than the ETS models.
Neither of the models is best suited for all circumstances.
Each time series would need to identify an appropriate ARIMA model.
With differing data, identifying models would require data analysis of all the different time series.


\todo[inline]{Rewrite so that it is comparison to the one above.}
\cite{Chu2003} showed that Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and ARIMA perform well when macro-economic
conditions are relatively stable. However, when economic conditions are volatile
ANNs outperform linear methods.
Their findings also support multi-step forecasting.


\todo[inline]{The same methdos as the two above. Write this in context with the other and refer to these.}
\cite{Weng2020} writes that ARIMA, SARIMA and Holt-Winter's
Exponential Smoothing model etc. are inconsistent with the actual changes in the sales
of retail stores.
Therefore the results are usually unstable due to their in-applicability
in the processing of nonlinear relationships.
However, statistical methods have the advantage of interpretability.
\cite{Bowen2020} wanted to use machine learning to maintain
the trade-off between interpretability and consistency with actual
changes in retail sales.
Two new machine learning models were applied in order to solve this.
LightGBM, an ensemble learning method, which is a further optimization of the XGB model.
And one model called Prophet \citep{Zunic2020}.

% What results did they get?
The study finds that traditional models such as ARIMA have trouble forecasting
due to the fast-moving domain of consumer retail buying patterns.
Additionally, their connection to external factors,
such as holidays and price changes, increases the complexity further.
The machine learning models performed better, with lower predictive error
and good interpretability.
However, the LightGDM model outperformed the Prophet model because of the prophet
models limitation to univariate time series.



\todo[inline]{Just a lot of details. Grouping can be explored, but the other is not needed I think. Write it comparision with the text listed above. Is it a continuation or a response to what has been done?}
The best example of related work we could find on our domain was
\cite{Bandara2019}.
They generate an accurate E-commerce sales forecasting model using LSTM  Neural Network.
They pool similar time series into clusters and train univariate, global models on each cluster.
The aim was to improve E-commerce sales forecasting by exploiting sales correlations and relationships
available in an E-commerce hierarchy.

Data preprocessing was done using a forward-filling strategy to impute missing sales
observations in the dataset.
The data was then normalized to accommodate the high sales volume ranges.
They then used the mean of the sales of a product as the scaling factor.

Two approaches to groupings were explored.
The first approach was based on domain knowledge.
Sales ranking and the percentage of zero sales were used as the primary business metrics
to form groups of products.
Group 1 represents their most popular products (67\% of sales), group 2 represents
their more unpopular products (33\% of sales), and group 3 represents the rest.

The second approach was based on time series clustering.
K-means clustering was used on a set of time-series features to identify groupings.
The first two features were business-specific features, namely "sales.quantile" and "zero.sales.percentage".
The rest of the features were time-series specific.
%They extracted features with the \textit{tsfeatures} package.
A silhouette analysis was utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters in the K-means algorithm.

% What results did they get?
The results outperformed the state-of-the-art univariate forecasting techniques.
Thereby concluding that E-commerce product hierarchies contain various cross-product demand
patterns and correlations.
Exploiting these relationships are necessary to improve the sales forecasting
accuracy in this domain.

With the effort to advance the predictive capabilities of models in e-commerce,
previous work done within the problem space is highly relevant as a starting point.
This shows what has already been accomplished and what new methods have not yet been attempted.
