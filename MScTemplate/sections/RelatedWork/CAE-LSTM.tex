\section{Convolutional Autoencoder and LSTM}

% This is a new type of time series forecasting method
% Other more simple methods are also used.
% LSTM is one of them, as well as some basic ARIMA and SVR (Suport vector regression?)

In an efort to increase the predictive accuracy and decrese the error metric in time series prediction,
new predictive methods are devised and tested.

One such method is proposed in the paper \cite{Khan2020}.
In order to decrease the predictive error, this paper explores the use of a Convolutional Autoencoder and LSTM.
Conducting experiments using this method, in comparison with a standard LSTM model,
the paper found that the propsed method resulted in predictions with lower error, using MAPE and RMSE as error metrics.
\todo[inline]{Add links to MAPE and RMSE from the Background and Theory chapter.}
Using datasets containing information about traffic flow, as well as factory equipment fault information,
the proposed method clearly outperformes the LSTM method.

The proposed method was created in order to properly deal with time series with high noise and fluctuations.
Due to the feature extraction ability of the convolutional network,
and the ability of the autoencoder to ignore noise data, the proposed model should be well suited for time series prediction with high noise data.


The paper also adds a comparison of the proposed method against and ARIMA model, and a SVR model, in addition to the LSTM model.
This shows a clear difference in the predicitve error of the different methods, in favor of the CNN-AE with LSTM.
The propsed method is much better at processing the higly fluctuating data features in the propsed datasets.
