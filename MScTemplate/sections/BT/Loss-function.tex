\subsubsection{Common Loss Functions}
% Common loss functions
The most commonly used loss function for regression problem is the 
\textbf{Mean Squared Error (MSE)} function in \autoref{eq:mean-squared-error}.
It is the mathematically preferred function if the target distribution is Guassian.
It punishes large errors much more harshly than smaller errors, due to its squaring of the error.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mean-squared-error}
  MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n e_t^2
\end{equation}

If the target distribution consists of outliers, then the 
\textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)} in \autoref{eq:mean-absolute-error} is more appropriate
as it does not punish the outliers too much.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mean-absolute-error}
  MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n |e_t|
\end{equation}
