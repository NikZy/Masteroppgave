\subsection{Convolution}
A convolutional neural network is a neural network architecture built using convolutional layers in order to extract information.
Unlike fully connected neural networks, convolutional layers interpret data using perceptive fields.
These perceptive fields evaluate only sections of the input at a time until the whole input is processed.
The convolutional layers attempt to extract features from the input data.
The first layer extracts low-level features, while the next layer extracts higher-level features, and so on.

Multiple kernels, or filters, are used to extract data from the input.
The result of applying these filters is known as the feature map, the extracted data features.

Convolutional layers have several applications within image classification,
image recognition, natural language processing, and time series analysis.
