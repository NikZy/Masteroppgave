Your motivation can be either application driven or technique/methodology driven. However in both cases, there will be an element of methodology driven due to the research focus of our group and the nature of a masters project.  
What other research has been conducted in this area and how is it related to your work? The text should clearly illustrate why your goals and research questions are important to address. This section is thus where your literate review will be presented. It is important when presenting the review that you present an overview of the motivating elements of the work going on in your field and how these relate to your proposal, rather than a list of contributors and what they have done. This means that you need to extract the key important factors for your work and discuss how others have addressed each of these factors and what the advantages/disadvantages are with such approaches. As you mention other authors, you should reference their work. Note that the reference list reflects the literature you have read and have cited. This will only be a subset of the literature that you have read.
