\subsection{Artificial Intelligense}
Artificial Intelligense (AI) is an umbrella term that encapsulates all algorithms that
show some intellent behavior.

Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI [\cref{fig:venn-diagram-ml-deep-learning}], is a system that learn automatically on its own through experiences.
It is not explicitly programmed by a programmer. A ML process makes observations from data to identify possible
patterns which can be used to make future decisions better. Machine Learning aims to allow a system to learn by itself through
experience without any kind of human intervention. Under the hood of many machine learning models are just plain statistics [\cref{fig:venn-diagram-cs-ml-deep-learning}].
The major difference between machine learning and statistics is their purpose.
Statistics is the mathematical study of data.
Machine learning models are designed to make the most accurate predictions.
