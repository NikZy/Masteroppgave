% What is the problem to be solved?
% - Prediction on a time series.
% - Prediction of trends on the time series

In todays society, online shopping has become more and more relevant.
More time than before is spent online.
The ease of use of online services and accessability to online retailers has increased vastly the last few years.
Due to this, most consumers consumers enlist some online services in order to shop goods and services.
As a result of this, wast ammounts of data has been collected on user shopping trends and habits on online platforms.
Analysing this data could prove useful in forecasting user activity and interests.
This could then be used to further improve the online services, in favor of the users and companies alike.

One application of such data is in predicting user trends and purchase patterns.
By analysing these patterns, online services could adjust their marketing, product portfolio and services to better fit the users.
To accomplish this, the collected data of user activity, price changes, promptions and so forth, could prove useful.
%%% TODO: Add a line of what the aim of the paper is? To improve the predictive ability of user trend analysis.


% Attempt to 

% -> Hybrid models -> Models with several methods -> Have shown to give better predictions....





% Need to relate this to the research questions stated in the project.

% What has already been done?
% - Solving this with statistical methods?
% - Solving using ARIMA.
% - Solving using ARIMA-BP (Back propagation neural network)
% - Solving using Convolution.
% - Solving using LSTM -> With grouping

Predicting user trends and sales patterns is by no means a new problem space.
Retailer have strugled with predicting sales patterns for years in order to improve the service they provide.
This could be to keep a more accurate ammount of product stroc on hand, changing prices, or altering their marketing strategies.
The field of time series forecasting has long been dominated by statistical methods to give a accurate forecasts.


Statistical methods such as ARIMA has show to performe well in predivtive forecasting.
In the paper from \textbf{[ Inser name and citation! ]} 


This problem space is not new, and there have been done previous work on predicting sales numbers in e-commerce.
One such solution is the application of methods such as ARIMA.
This methods has shown to performe well with forecasting, such as explored in the paper by [Insert paper.].
% Unfortunatly, methods such as ARIMA are Univariate methods [Link to where univariate is explained].
% Explain that univariate is not good?

% Papers has explained that Machine learning has become better sutited for time series forecasting the last yeas, so we look into this....
% And add citation to the paper or section of this.













Statistical methods for sales prediction such as ARIMA has shown to performe well on these forecasting methods.
- What is a example of such a paper?
% - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584515000137] (This paper was found from referance 5 in "Application of Machine Learning Model and Hybrid Model in Retail Sales Forecast")

Such statistical methods have also been coupled with other methods.
One such example is the coupling of ARIMA with a Back-Propagation Neural Network.
[Add reference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9181926]
The research shows that combining the statistical method with the neural network gave less predictive error than either one acomplished on their own.

Other research have focused on applying more complex machine learning methods in order to accomplish accurate predictions.

% The hybrid text -> ARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet and LightLGB are used. Shows good results for LightLGB.

% What is missing from the previous solutions?
% - How could they have been improved?
% - Using neural networks insted of statistical learning




% Our solution?
% - What is our solution?
% - How would this solution address the problem?
% - Is there a reason why this is not done before?

Your motivation can be either application driven or technique/methodology driven.
However in both cases, there will be an element of methodology driven due to the research focus of our group and the nature of a masters project.  
What other research has been conducted in this area and how is it related to your work?
The text should clearly illustrate why your goals and research questions are important to address.
This section is thus where your literate review will be presented.
It is important when presenting the review that you present an overview of the motivating elements of the work going on in your field and how these relate to your proposal, rather than a list of contributors and what they have done.
This means that you need to extract the key important factors for your work and discuss how others have addressed each of these factors and what the advantages/disadvantages are with such approaches.
As you mention other authors, you should reference their work. Note that the reference list reflects the literature you have read and have cited.
This will only be a subset of the literature that you have read.
