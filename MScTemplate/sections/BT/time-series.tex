\subsection{Time Series}
\label{sec:time-series}
\begin{quote}
    A time series is a sequence of data
    points that occur in successive order over some period of time.

In a time series, time is often the independent variable.
A time series has several properties worth mentioning.
Is it stationary?
A stationary time series if its statistical properties do not change over time.
In other words, if it has a variance, mean and covariance which is independent of time.

Does the time series have seasonality?
If it follows periodic fluctuations, like how electricity usage varies during a 24-hour period,
then it has seasonality.

If a time series has a strong autocorrelation then there is a big
correlation between observations with a time lag between them.

\subsection{Modeling time series}
A naive approach to time series modeling is predicting that the next observation will be the
mean of all past observations. A better approach is to is to define a smaller window, and
apply the moving average across the whole series. Longer window size equals a smoother graph.

Exponential smoothing uses the same approach,
but assigns a different decreasing weight is assigned to each observation.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:exponential_smoothing}
    y = \alpha x_t + (1 - \alpha)y_{y-1}, t > 0
\end{equation}

\autoref{eq:exponential_smoothing}
shows exponential smoothing, where $\alpha$ smoothing factor
that takes values between 0 and 1. It determines how fast the weight decreases with time.
