\todo[inline]{
Here you need to include your structured review protocol including search engine, search words, research questions  (for search, not the masters research questions), inclusion createrias and evaluation Criterias.

A structural literature review was conducted to find related work for this project.
Search engines used:
\textit{
ACM digital library,
IEEE Xplore,
ISI web of knowledge,
ScienceDirect,
CiteSeer,
SpringerLink and,
Google Scholar
}

Our search terms are listen in \autoref{tab:search-terms-table-1} and \autoref{tab:search-terms-table-2}.
The term \textit{Anomaly detection} was removed as a term after our goals shifted away from anomaly detection and towards prediction.
This change was documented in our \textit{Decision Matrix}\autoref{cha:decision_matrix}.

In order to carry out the SLR we defined our problem and research questions
