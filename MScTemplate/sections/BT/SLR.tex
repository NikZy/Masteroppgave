\todo[inline]{
Here you need to include your structured review protocol including search engine, search words, research questions  (for search, not the masters research questions), inclusion createrias and evaluation Criterias.

A structural literature review (SLR) was conducted to find related work for this project.
The SLR process is based on \cite{AndersKofod-Petersen2018}.
This section will briefly describe our process, deveations from the process,
and changes made during the process.

\subsection{Step 1: Idendification of research}
In order to retrieve all relevant literature to the topic we defined our
research questions and terms.

We included the most known search engines as our sources:

\textit{
ACM digital library,
IEEE Xplore,
ISI web of knowledge,
ScienceDirect,
CiteSeer,
SpringerLink and,
Google Scholar
}

Our search terms are listen in \autoref{tab:search-terms-table-1} and \autoref{tab:search-terms-table-2}.
We used a Notion database to keep track of all the papers. The whole database is available here: \cite{slrdatabase}.
%[\href{https://northern-leech-f32.notion.site/Academic-Writing-ca43d0467e5c40149343d8a85136290f}{Notion SRL database}].
We used another Notion Database to keep track of our searches, and track where how we found each Research Paper
\cite{searchtermtable}

Our method for adding literatur to the Notion database was:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a source search engine
    \item Search the search engine applying AND $\wedge$ and OR $\vee$ using our search terms
    \item Add the Search Term and Source combination to the Search Term Database.
    \item Title and abstract inclusion screening. Add all remotely relevant papers to Notion, and link them with the correct Search Term Database.
    \item Continue until relevant papers are far in between
    \item Repeat whole process with a new search engine
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Devations}
We did end up with some deviations to the algorithm above.
Some papers we found by accident when researching the topic. 
They were too important to not add, but they were too general of it to be worth
a change to our search terms without including a big set of non-relevant papers.
All papers found by accident was also added with a search term table row documenting 
how the paper was found.

Some of the best papers we found referenced some really good papers. These were also 
added to Notion.

The term \textit{Anomaly detection} was removed as a term after our goals shifted away from anomaly detection and towards prediction.
This change was documented in our \textit{Decision Matrix}, which is publicly available here:
\cite{decisionmatrix}.
